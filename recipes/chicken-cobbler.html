            <li>4 cups rotisserie chicken meat, shredded</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) bag frozen mixed vegetables</li>
            <li>1 (11.36 ounce) package Cheddar bay biscuit mix (such as Red Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuit Mix)</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>

            <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley (optional)</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place butter in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish and place in the oven to melt.</li>
            <li>When butter is melted, add chicken in a single layer over the butter. Top evenly with frozen veggies.</li>
            <li>Stir together biscuit mix, seasoning packet from the mix, and milk in a bowl until well blended; pour over the chicken and veggies. Spread lightly and evenly over the top of the  mixture but do not stir.</li>
            <li>Whisk together soup and stock in a second bowl until smooth. Pour over biscuit mix but do not stir.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven uncovered until very golden brown and only very slightly jiggly in the center, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle parsley over the top if desired and let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
